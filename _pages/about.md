Hello! Iâ€™m Yanjie Li (Peter), PhD Candidate in AI security.
## About Me

* My hometown is Shandong province, China.
* As a passionate researcher in AI security, I am driven by curiosity and the desire to solve real-world problems. Currently, I am pursuing my PhD at Hong Kong Polytechnic University, where I explore the physical 3D adversarial attacks and MLLM securities.

## My Journey

* I started my academic journey at Central South University in Changsha, China, where I received my Bachelor's in Control Engineering.
* Then I got my Master degree from Zhejiang University and focused on IoT security. 
* From September 2021 to now, I am a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University.
* From During Feb. 2024-Aug. 2024, I was exchanged to University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) and studied the security of LLM agents.

## Research Interests
My research interests lie at the intersection of AI security. I am particularly fascinated by: 
- Adversarial attacks in the physical world
- Adversarial attacks for multi-modal large language
- The security of LLM agents

## Fun Facts
When I'm not immersed in research, you can find me traveling, exploring new hiking trails, playing table tennis and badminton. I believe that a well-rounded life contributes to creativity and innovation in research!
