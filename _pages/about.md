Hello! Iâ€™m Yanjie Li (Peter), PhD Candidate in AI security.
About Me

My hometown is Shandong province, China.
As a passionate researcher in AI security, I am driven by curiosity and the desire to solve real-world problems. Currently, I am pursuing my PhD at Hong Kong Polytechnic University, where I explore the physical 3D adversarial attacks and MLLM securities.

My Journey
I started my academic journey at Central South University (https://en.csu.edu.cn/index.htm) in Changsha, China, where I received my Bachelor's in Control Engineering. The I went to Zhejiang University, where I honed my skills in Control Science and Engineering and focused on IoT security. During Feb.2024-Aug.2024, I was exchanged to University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and study the security of LLM agents.

Research Interests
My research interests lie at the intersection of AI security. I am particularly fascinated by:

[Interest 1]: Adversarial Attacks in the Physical World
[Interest 2]: Adversarial Attacks for multi-modal large language models (MLLM)
[Interest 3]: The security of LLM Agents

Fun Facts
When I'm not immersed in research, you can find me traveling, exploring new hiking trails, playing table tennis and badminton. I believe that a well-rounded life contributes to creativity and innovation in research!

Get in Touch
I love connecting with fellow researchers, students, or anyone interested in [your research area]. Feel free to reach out via my Email!

Thank You for Visiting!
I look forward to sharing my journey with you and exploring opportunities for collaboration and discussion!
