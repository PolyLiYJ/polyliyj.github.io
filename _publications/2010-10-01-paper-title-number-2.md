Benefiting from the rapid development of deep learning, 2D and 3D computer vision applications are deployed in many safe-critical systems, such as autopilot and identity authentication. However, deep learning models are not trustworthy enough because of their limited robustness against adversarial attacks. The physically realizable adversarial attacks further pose fatal threats to the application and human safety. Lots of papers have emerged to investigate the robustness and safety of deep learning models against adversarial attacks. To lead to trustworthy AI, we first construct a general threat model from different perspectives and then comprehensively review the latest progress of both 2D and 3D adversarial attacks. We extend the concept of adversarial examples beyond imperceptive perturbations and collate over 170 papers to give an overview of deep learning model robustness against various adversarial attacks...
