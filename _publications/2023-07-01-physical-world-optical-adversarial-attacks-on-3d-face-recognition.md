The success rate of current adversarial attacks remains low on real-world 3D face recognition tasks because the 3D-printing attacks need to meet the requirement that the generated points should be adjacent to the surface, which limits the adversarial example' searching space. Additionally, they have not considered unpredictable head movements or the non-homogeneous nature of skin reflectance in the real world. To address the real-world challenges, we propose a novel structured-light attack against structured-light-based 3D face recognition. We incorporate the 3D reconstruction process and skin's reflectance in the optimization process to get the end-to-end attack and present 3D transform invariant loss and sensitivity maps to improve robustness. Our attack enables adversarial points to be placed in any position and is resilient to random head movements while maintaining the perturbation unnoticeable. Experiments show that our new method can attack point-cloud-based and depth-image-based 3D face recognition systems with a high success rate, using fewer perturbations than previous physical 3D adversarial attacks.
